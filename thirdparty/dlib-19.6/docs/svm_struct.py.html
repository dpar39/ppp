<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># This is an example illustrating the use of the structural SVM solver from</span>
<span class="c1"># the dlib C++ Library.  Therefore, this example teaches you the central ideas</span>
<span class="c1"># needed to setup a structural SVM model for your machine learning problems.  To</span>
<span class="c1"># illustrate the process, we use dlib&#39;s structural SVM solver to learn the</span>
<span class="c1"># parameters of a simple multi-class classifier.  We first discuss the</span>
<span class="c1"># multi-class classifier model and then walk through using the structural SVM</span>
<span class="c1"># tools to find the parameters of this classification model.     As an aside,</span>
<span class="c1"># dlib&#39;s C++ interface to the structural SVM solver is threaded.  So on a</span>
<span class="c1"># multi-core computer it is significantly faster than using the python</span>
<span class="c1"># interface.  So consider using the C++ interface instead if you find that</span>
<span class="c1"># running it in python is slow.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># COMPILING/INSTALLING THE DLIB PYTHON INTERFACE</span>
<span class="c1">#   You can install dlib using the command:</span>
<span class="c1">#       pip install dlib</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#   Alternatively, if you want to compile dlib yourself then go into the dlib</span>
<span class="c1">#   root folder and run:</span>
<span class="c1">#       python setup.py install</span>
<span class="c1">#   or</span>
<span class="c1">#       python setup.py install --yes USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS</span>
<span class="c1">#   if you have a CPU that supports AVX instructions, since this makes some</span>
<span class="c1">#   things run faster.  </span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#   Compiling dlib should work on any operating system so long as you have</span>
<span class="c1">#   CMake and boost-python installed.  On Ubuntu, this can be done easily by</span>
<span class="c1">#   running the command:</span>
<span class="c1">#       sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev cmake</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">dlib</span>

    <span class="c1"># In this example, we have three types of samples: class 0, 1, or 2.  That</span>
    <span class="c1"># is, each of our sample vectors falls into one of three classes.  To keep</span>
    <span class="c1"># this example very simple, each sample vector is zero everywhere except at</span>
    <span class="c1"># one place.  The non-zero dimension of each vector determines the class of</span>
    <span class="c1"># the vector.  So for example, the first element of samples has a class of 1</span>
    <span class="c1"># because samples[0][1] is the only non-zero element of samples[0].</span>
    <span class="n">samples</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">]]</span>
    <span class="c1"># Since we want to use a machine learning method to learn a 3-class</span>
    <span class="c1"># classifier we need to record the labels of our samples.  Here samples[i]</span>

    <span class="c1"># Now that we have some training data we can tell the structural SVM to</span>
    <span class="c1"># learn the parameters of our 3-class classifier model.  The details of this</span>
    <span class="c1"># will be explained later.  For now, just note that it finds the weights</span>
    <span class="c1"># (i.e. a vector of real valued parameters) such that predict_label(weights,</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ThreeClassClassifierProblem</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1"># Now we arrive at the meat of this example program.  To use the</span>
    <span class="c1"># dlib.solve_structural_svm_problem() routine you need to define an object</span>
    <span class="c1"># which tells the structural SVM solver what to do for your problem.  In</span>
    <span class="c1"># this example, this is done by defining the ThreeClassClassifierProblem</span>
    <span class="c1"># object.  Before we get into the details, we first discuss some background</span>
    <span class="c1"># information on structural SVMs.</span>
    <span class="c1">#</span>
    <span class="c1"># A structural SVM is a supervised machine learning method for learning to</span>
    <span class="c1"># predict complex outputs.  This is contrasted with a binary classifier</span>
    <span class="c1"># which makes only simple yes/no predictions.  A structural SVM, on the</span>
    <span class="c1"># other hand, can learn to predict complex outputs such as entire parse</span>
    <span class="c1"># trees or DNA sequence alignments.  To do this, it learns a function F(x,y)</span>
    <span class="c1"># which measures how well a particular data sample x matches a label y,</span>
    <span class="c1"># where a label is potentially a complex thing like a parse tree. However,</span>
    <span class="c1"># to keep this example program simple we use only a 3 category label output.</span>
    <span class="c1">#</span>
    <span class="c1"># At test time, the best label for a new x is given by the y which</span>
    <span class="c1"># maximizes F(x,y). To put this into the context of the current example,</span>
    <span class="c1"># F(x,y) computes the score for a given sample and class label.  The</span>
    <span class="c1"># predicted class label is therefore whatever value of y which makes F(x,y)</span>
    <span class="c1"># the biggest.  This is exactly what predict_label() does. That is, it</span>
    <span class="c1"># computes F(x,0), F(x,1), and F(x,2) and then reports which label has the</span>
    <span class="c1"># biggest value.</span>
    <span class="c1">#</span>
    <span class="c1"># At a high level, a structural SVM can be thought of as searching the</span>
    <span class="c1"># parameter space of F(x,y) for the set of parameters that make the</span>
    <span class="c1"># following inequality true as often as possible:</span>
    <span class="c1">#     F(x_i,y_i) &gt; max{over all incorrect labels of x_i} F(x_i, y_incorrect)</span>
    <span class="c1"># That is, it seeks to find the parameter vector such that F(x,y) always</span>
    <span class="c1"># gives the highest score to the correct output.  To define the structural</span>
    <span class="c1"># SVM optimization problem precisely, we first introduce some notation:</span>
    <span class="c1">#    - let PSI(x,y)    == the joint feature vector for input x and a label y</span>
    <span class="c1">#    - let F(x,y|w)    == dot(w,PSI(x,y)).</span>
    <span class="c1">#      (we use the | notation to emphasize that F() has the parameter vector</span>
    <span class="c1">#       of weights called w)</span>
    <span class="c1">#    - let LOSS(idx,y) == the loss incurred for predicting that the</span>
    <span class="c1">#      idx-th training  sample has a label of y.  Note that LOSS()</span>
    <span class="c1">#      should always be &gt;= 0 and should become exactly 0 when y is the</span>
    <span class="c1">#      correct label for the idx-th sample.  Moreover, it should notionally</span>
    <span class="c1">#      indicate how bad it is to predict y for the idx&#39;th sample.</span>
    <span class="c1">#    - let x_i == the i-th training sample.</span>
    <span class="c1">#    - let y_i == the correct label for the i-th training sample.</span>
    <span class="c1">#    - The number of data samples is N.</span>
    <span class="c1">#</span>
    <span class="c1"># Then the optimization problem solved by a structural SVM using</span>
    <span class="c1"># dlib.solve_structural_svm_problem() is the following:</span>
    <span class="c1">#     Minimize: h(w) == 0.5*dot(w,w) + C*R(w)</span>
    <span class="c1">#</span>
    <span class="c1">#     Where R(w) == sum from i=1 to N: 1/N * sample_risk(i,w) and</span>
    <span class="c1">#     sample_risk(i,w) == max over all</span>
    <span class="c1">#         Y: LOSS(i,Y) + F(x_i,Y|w) - F(x_i,y_i|w) and C &gt; 0</span>
    <span class="c1">#</span>
    <span class="c1"># You can think of the sample_risk(i,w) as measuring the degree of error</span>
    <span class="c1"># you would make when predicting the label of the i-th sample using</span>
    <span class="c1"># parameters w.  That is, it is zero only when the correct label would be</span>
    <span class="c1"># predicted and grows larger the more &quot;wrong&quot; the predicted output becomes.</span>
    <span class="c1"># Therefore, the objective function is minimizing a balance between making</span>
    <span class="c1"># the weights small (typically this reduces overfitting) and fitting the</span>
    <span class="c1"># training data.  The degree to which you try to fit the data is controlled</span>
    <span class="c1"># by the C parameter.</span>
    <span class="c1">#</span>
    <span class="c1"># For a more detailed introduction to structured support vector machines</span>
    <span class="c1"># you should consult the following paper:</span>
    <span class="c1">#     Predicting Structured Objects with Support Vector Machines by</span>
    <span class="c1">#     Thorsten Joachims, Thomas Hofmann, Yisong Yue, and Chun-nam Yu</span>
    <span class="c1">#</span>

    <span class="c1"># Finally, we come back to the code.  To use</span>
    <span class="c1"># dlib.solve_structural_svm_problem() you need to provide the things</span>
    <span class="c1"># discussed above.  This is the value of C, the number of training samples,</span>
    <span class="c1"># the dimensionality of PSI(), as well as methods for calculating the loss</span>
    <span class="c1"># values and PSI() vectors.  You will also need to write code that can</span>
    <span class="c1"># compute:</span>
    <span class="c1"># max over all Y: LOSS(i,Y) + F(x_i,Y|w).  To summarize, the</span>
    <span class="c1"># ThreeClassClassifierProblem class is required to have the following</span>
    <span class="c1"># fields:</span>
    <span class="c1">#   - C</span>
    <span class="c1">#   - num_samples</span>
    <span class="c1">#   - num_dimensions</span>
    <span class="c1">#   - get_truth_joint_feature_vector()</span>
    <span class="c1">#   - separation_oracle()</span>

    <span class="n">C</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

    <span class="c1"># There are also a number of optional arguments:</span>
    <span class="c1"># epsilon is the stopping tolerance.  The optimizer will run until R(w) is</span>
    <span class="c1"># within epsilon of its optimal value. If you don&#39;t set this then it</span>
    <span class="c1"># defaults to 0.001.</span>
    <span class="c1"># epsilon = 1e-13</span>

    <span class="c1"># Uncomment this and the optimizer will print its progress to standard</span>
    <span class="c1"># out.  You will be able to see things like the current risk gap.  The</span>
    <span class="c1"># optimizer continues until the</span>
    <span class="c1"># risk gap is below epsilon.</span>
    <span class="c1"># be_verbose = True</span>

    <span class="c1"># If you want to require that the learned weights are all non-negative</span>
    <span class="c1"># then set this field to True.</span>
    <span class="c1"># learns_nonnegative_weights = True</span>

    <span class="c1"># The optimizer uses an internal cache to avoid unnecessary calls to your</span>
    <span class="c1"># separation_oracle() routine.  This parameter controls the size of that</span>
    <span class="c1"># cache.  Bigger values use more RAM and might make the optimizer run</span>
    <span class="c1"># faster.  You can also disable it by setting it to 0 which is good to do</span>
    <span class="c1"># when your separation_oracle is very fast.  If If you don&#39;t call this</span>
    <span class="c1"># function it defaults to a value of 5.</span>
    <span class="c1"># max_cache_size = 20</span>

        <span class="c1"># label.  So now that we are in the structural SVM code we have to</span>
        <span class="c1"># define the PSI vector to correspond to this usage.  That is, we need</span>
        <span class="c1"># to setup PSI so that argmax_y dot(weights,PSI(x,y)) ==</span>
        <span class="c1"># predict_label(weights,x).  This is how we tell the structural SVM</span>
        <span class="c1"># solver what kind of problem we are trying to solve.</span>
        <span class="c1">#</span>
        <span class="c1"># It&#39;s worth emphasizing that the single biggest step in using a</span>
        <span class="c1"># structural SVM is deciding how you want to represent PSI(x,label).  It</span>
        <span class="c1"># is always a vector, but deciding what to put into it to solve your</span>
        <span class="c1"># problem is often not a trivial task. Part of the difficulty is that</span>
        <span class="c1"># you need an efficient method for finding the label that makes</span>
        <span class="c1"># dot(w,PSI(x,label)) the biggest.  Sometimes this is easy, but often</span>
        <span class="c1"># finding the max scoring label turns into a difficult combinatorial</span>
        <span class="c1"># optimization problem.  So you need to pick a PSI that doesn&#39;t make the</span>
        <span class="c1"># label maximization step intractable but also still well models your</span>
        <span class="c1"># problem.</span>
        <span class="c1">#</span>
        <span class="c1"># Create a dense vector object (note that you can also use unsorted</span>
        <span class="c1"># sparse vectors (i.e.  dlib.sparse_vector objects) to represent your</span>
        <span class="c1"># PSI vector.  This is useful if you have very high dimensional PSI</span>
        <span class="c1"># vectors that are mostly zeros.  In the context of this example, you</span>
        <span class="c1"># would simply return a dlib.sparse_vector at the end of make_psi() and</span>

    <span class="c1"># separation_oracle() is more interesting.</span>
    <span class="c1"># dlib.solve_structural_svm_problem() will call separation_oracle() many</span>
    <span class="c1"># times during the optimization.  Each time it will give it the current</span>
    <span class="c1"># value of the parameter weights and the separation_oracle() is supposed to</span>
    <span class="c1"># find the label that most violates the structural SVM objective function</span>
    <span class="c1"># for the idx-th sample.  Then the separation oracle reports the</span>
    <span class="c1"># corresponding PSI vector and loss value.  To state this more precisely,</span>
    <span class="c1"># the separation_oracle() member function has the following contract:</span>
    <span class="c1">#   requires</span>
    <span class="c1">#      - 0 &lt;= idx &lt; self.num_samples</span>
    <span class="c1">#      - len(current_solution) == self.num_dimensions</span>
    <span class="c1">#   ensures</span>
    <span class="c1">#      - runs the separation oracle on the idx-th sample.</span>
    <span class="c1">#        We define this as follows:</span>
    <span class="c1">#         - let X           == the idx-th training sample.</span>
    <span class="c1">#         - let PSI(X,y)    == the joint feature vector for input X</span>
    <span class="c1">#                              and an arbitrary label y.</span>
    <span class="c1">#         - let F(X,y)      == dot(current_solution,PSI(X,y)).</span>
    <span class="c1">#         - let LOSS(idx,y) == the loss incurred for predicting that the</span>
    <span class="c1">#           idx-th sample has a label of y.  Note that LOSS()</span>
    <span class="c1">#           should always be &gt;= 0 and should become exactly 0 when y is the</span>
    <span class="c1">#           correct label for the idx-th sample.</span>
    <span class="c1">#  </span>
    <span class="c1">#            Then the separation oracle finds a Y such that:</span>
    <span class="c1">#               Y = argmax over all y: LOSS(idx,y) + F(X,y)</span>
    <span class="c1">#            (i.e. It finds the label which maximizes the above expression.)</span>
    <span class="c1">#  </span>
    <span class="c1">#            Finally, separation_oracle() returns LOSS(idx,Y),PSI(X,Y)</span>
